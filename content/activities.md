## New Highlights for This Edition

To further enhance participant engagement, EARL 2025 will introduce:

- **Best Paper Award:** This award will recognize originality, technical rigor, and impact in LLM-based recommendation research. The selection will combine reviewer evaluations and organizer deliberation.
- **Poster Presentations:** We are excited to feature a dedicated poster session during the coffee break on our workshop day, _September 26_. For general preparation guidelines, you can consult the [Instruction for Poster Authors](https://recsys.acm.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Instruction-for-Poster-Authors.pdf), but be aware that our session timing is specific to the workshop.

## Invited Talks

The EARL workshop proudly presents 2 invited talks, who will provide in-depth insights into the latest developments in the integration of large language models with recommendation systems. 
- **Invited Talk 1: _LLMs for Next-Generation Recommender Systems: From Understanding User Behavior to Deployment_**  
   **Wei-Wei Du** (**Sony Group Corporation**), **Tommaso Carraro** (**Sony AI**)  
   Abstract: Large language models are opening new frontiers in recommender systems, enabling richer representations of user behavior, improved handling of cold-start scenarios, and the development of recommendation agents. In the first part of this talk, we will present recent advances in aligning temporal intervals with the language modality and discuss how LLMs can mitigate data sparsity challenges. In the second part of this talk, we will discuss recommendation system agents and present a brief demo of them.

- **Invited Talk 2: _Agentic Marketplace: The next era of recommendation system_**  
   **Wenyue Hua** (**Microsoft Research, AI Frontier**)  
   Abstract: As autonomous agents begin making economic decisions on behalf of humans, understanding their market behavior becomes critical for designing stable autonomous agent economies. Existing research focuses primarily on isolated two-agent negotiations or theoretical game scenarios, leaving gaps in real-world market interactions. We introduce the Agentic Marketplace, a three-tier platform where Assistant agents search, negotiate, and transact while Service agents compete through pricing and offerings. In experiments across numerous high-fidelity marketplace configurations, we compare the welfare that autonomous agents achieved against optimal welfare. We study the impact of recommendation accuracy, recency bias, resilience of the such marketplace under red teaming. These findings establish metrics to measure market health and provide insights for designing resilient agentic marketplaces.
