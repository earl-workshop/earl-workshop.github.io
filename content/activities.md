## Workshop Activities

The EARL Workshop will build on the successful structure of its first edition, combining expert insights with interactive academic discourse. The core program will feature:

- **Invited Talks:** 2–3 leading researchers and practitioners from academia and industry will present the latest advances at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and recommender systems (RSs), discussing emerging challenges and future directions.
- **Accepted Contribution Talks:** Selected authors will present their accepted research papers. Talk durations will be adapted based on the number of presentations to ensure depth and audience engagement.

## New Highlights for This Edition

To further enhance participant engagement, EARL 2025 will introduce:

- **Best Paper Award:** This award will recognize originality, technical rigor, and impact in LLM-based recommendation research. The selection will combine reviewer evaluations and organizer deliberation.
- **Interactive Panel Discussion:** A dynamic panel of experts will address pressing issues in the field. Audience members will be invited to submit questions in advance and engage in real-time discussions during the session, fostering rich dialogue between academia and industry.
