## Related Topics:

The EARL Workshop welcomes submissions on (1) emerging techniques for LLM-based RSs (including retrieval-augmented generation, multi-modal recommendation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, scalable fine-tuning methods, dynamic prompting strategies, and personalized conversational agents), (2) real-world applications of existing LLMs, and (3) critical challenges in ensuring the trustworthiness and responsibility of LLM-driven RSs.

In detail, topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Integrating LLMs to enhance RSs.
- Leveraging LLM-generated data to improve traditional RSs.
- LLM fine-tuning or prompt engineering techniques for RSs.
- Developing interactive and conversational RSs with LLMs.
- Integration of reinforcement learning with LLMs to adapt recommendations based on user feedback.
- Leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve relevance and diversity in recommendations.
- Multi-modal RSs powered by LLMs, e.g., techniques integrating text, images, and audio data.
- Few-shot and zero-shot learning for LLM-based RSs.
- Personalization strategies for LLM-powered RSs, including dynamic user modeling and real-time adaptation.
- Cross-domain and cross-lingual RSs utilizing multilingual and generalist LLMs.
- Applications of LLM-enhanced RSs in domains such as finance, streaming platforms, and social networks.
- Scalability challenges in deploying LLM-powered RSs.
- Efficiency challenges in deploying LLM-powered RSs.
- Evaluation of LLM-powered RSs using novel metrics/standards.
- Evaluation of LLM-powered RSs using human feedback.
- Enhancing transparency in LLM-powered RSs.
- Enhancing fairness in LLM-powered RSs.
- Enhancing explainability in LLM-powered RSs.
- Trustworthy recommendation with LLMs, addressing bias, safety, privacy, and authenticity issues.
- Responsible AI practices in LLM-powered RSs, emphasizing ethical considerations and sustainable AI.

## Paper submission  
- Authors are encouraged to submit contributions in one of the following formats.
  - Long Papers: detail significant and enduring contributions (up to 10 pages, with extra pages permissible for references); 
  - Short Papers: ideally suited for presenting new and promising work that hasn't yet reached the maturity required for a long paper (up to 5 pages, with the option to include additional pages for references). 
  - Authors are required to submit manuscripts adhering to the ACM format: [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)
