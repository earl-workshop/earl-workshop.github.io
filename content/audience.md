## Invited Talks:

The EARL workshop proudly presents a series of 2-3 invited talks by esteemed leaders from both industry and academia, who will provide in-depth insights into the latest developments in the integration of large language models with recommendation systems. In addition, our workshop will showcase 8-10 paper highlight talks, offering a platform for selected contributors to present their innovative and forward-thinking research that aligns with our theme, ensuring these sessions are both informative and impact.


## Coffee Break:

A central feature of the EARL workshop is the interactive poster session, coupled with a coffee break. This session is not merely an opportunity to delve into specific research topics, but also a perfect setting for attendees to network and engage in meaningful discussions, fostering a collaborative environment. 



## Thought-provoking panel discussion:

Moreover, the workshop includes a thought-provoking panel discussion, bringing together a diverse group of experts from both the industry and academic realms. This discussion aims to address the current challenges and future potential of recommendation systems enhanced by large language models, facilitating a rich exchange of ideas and perspectives from different sectors of the field.

## Q&A:

In an effort to make the panel discussion more interactive and tailored to our audience's interests, we will be collecting questions from participants upon workshop registration. These pre-selected questions will then be posed to our panelists, ensuring that the session is not only engaging but also reflective of the attendees' curiosities and concerns. This approach is designed to create a dynamic and participatory atmosphere, encouraging lively and informed dialogue among all participants.
