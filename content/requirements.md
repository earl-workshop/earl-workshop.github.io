workshop is based on what we think will be most useful for most of our
learners. Here we try to balance between usefulness and privacy and hope we are
doing a good job. If you are unsure about anything or do not agree with our
choice, feel free to contact us or contribute directly to our lesson material
to make it more inclusive while also being useful for the majority of our
learners.
